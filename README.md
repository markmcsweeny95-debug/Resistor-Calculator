# Resistor-Calculator
A python code designed to allow the user to easily enter the value of resistor they desire and be told the colours as well as shown it using pythons turtle feature, it also allows the user to enter the colour o the resistor they have and it will determine the value of it.

Functions-
1- User can tell the code the colour of their resistor bands and the code will process it including decapitalising and re-sorting and give the user the resistor value of their resistor 
2- User can tell the code the value of their resistor and the code will process it and use python's built in turtle feature to create a drawing of the resistor they are looking for, perfect if you are trying to find a specific one in a box
3- User can tell the code the value of their resistor and the code will process it and tell the user the colours of the bands on that resistor
